# TanStack Starter Template

This is a simple starter template for a project using [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest). It demonstrates how to quickly scaffold a project, set up routes, and manage application state efficiently.

## Features

- **Loader Data**: Fetch and display data using TanStack's route loader.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Modify state and refresh loader data using `router.invalidate()`.
- **Styled UI**: Includes a basic layout with responsive styles.

## Getting Started

To start using this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-tanstack-app@latest --template tanstack-router
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. The generated files include basic starter functionality from TanStack, so you can build on top of them or replace specific components with the code in this repository as needed.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or use the starter command above to create a new app.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your application.
